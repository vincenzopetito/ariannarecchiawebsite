                <h3>The problem</h3>
                <p>Users found it challenging to find answers on the FAQ page, particularly as this section was only visible for logged in users. After a meeting with the Support team we became aware that users found it challenging to find answers in our FAQs, particularly as this section was only visible for logged in users. As an intermediary between the Support and Product teams, I acted as the design lead for this project.</p>
                <h3>The goal</h3>
                <p>Make a ‘Knowledge Base’ accessible and shareable, so the Support team can better assist our users or potential users.</p>
                <h3>The research</h3>
                <p>What are the associated struggles of having a 'closed' FAQs webpage?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Causing friction</li>

                        <li>Fragmented content</li>

        <div class="cols three-cols">
            <div>
                <h4>- Provide guidance</h4>
                <p>Providing guidance for a crypto system is not an easy job. Opportunities include guidance through better categorisation and a clearer Q&A section.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>- Build for inclusion</h4>
                <p>Designing for inclusivity opens services to more people reflecting on how people really are and putting people in the center from the very beginning of the process.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>- Give more clarity</h4>
                <p>Our users should feel like there’s no gap or lack of information. The website should include all the answers the user might need and should inspire trust in our content and data.</p>

                <p>Having a way to better navigate through all the information needed a ‘compass’ so we decided to include a section on top where users could better access FAQs.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>- Faster answers</h4>
                <p>Bringing on top of the page a section with the ‘Popular articles’ might decrease the amount of tickets the Support team receives everyday.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>- Giving feedback</h4>
                <p>Positive and negative feedback will help us to better connect with users and will allow us to keep the website up to date.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>- Familiarity</h4>
                <p>The interface should use terms and concepts which are drawn from the experience of the people who will make most of use of the Knowledge Base.</p>

                <h3>First Observation</h3>
                <p>To kick off our designs, we first needed to consider the type of content, copy, and media we would need to account for. We started by reviewing a rough draft of the new content and then working with our copywriter to update the copy for the app section. While designing, I took into consideration all the information gathered during our usability test and started the research phase looking at great FAQs pages from companies like Atlassian and Shopify and then worked on the architecture to have a more ‘standardised’ webpage.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>One of the challenges was creating a design solution that wasn’t overwhelming. Due to the nature of the Knowledge base, the design could easily get text-heavy and overwhelm the users. We actively tried to solve this by breaking content into sections, adding a video centre, and creating interactive feedback CTAs, allowing the user to tell us if the article was useful or not, with room for feedback.</p>
        <h3>The Value Of Feedback</h3>
        <p>After testing our initial design we tested the feedback section and we received suggestion about being able to express what it could be improved in the article without leaving the website. Most users felt the need to find a quicker way to give feedback otherwise they will not bother giving it. I extensively researched before coming up to a new solution.</p>

                <h3>The final design</h3>
                <p>I regularly updated the team on the status of the project in Slack or during our design critique sessions to make sure everyone knew what was happening and that we stayed on track with our timeline.<br/><br/> After working on this project for 5 months, I announced the launch to everyone at Gravity. I fielded questions from Support on the project and received positive feedback shortly after, particularly with regards to the improvements in the overall experience for our Gravity users.</p>
