            <p>Earlier in 2020 we introduced an all new experience on Gravity: Price. Users could now have an overview about their assets’ price in different time slots: 24h, 7 days and 1 month. But not only that, they could also set a price alert allowing them to fast buy or sell at targeted price.</p>
            <p>Research made it clear that this was a feature that users really wanted but also that it might have changed the users’ behaviour. We firstly discussed about the possibility to have this feature directly on the homepage so we decided to do a gorilla testing with some random users to test the new features.</p>
            <h3>It's test time!</h3>
            <p>We tested 22 people and after have offered them a donuts we asked them a couple of questions about the features (after a brief onboarding) and what we could improve in their opinion.</p>

            <p>We tested 3 tasks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find the price of how much is 1 BSV</li>
                <li>Find the price of how much was 1 BSV 24h ago</li>
                <li>Create a price alert</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most of the feedback we received were positive and followed the UX flow but some highlighted the need to have the price in the currency page and to have a more prominent CTA with a way to create price alerts by inputting a number.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>This first iteration had the aim togive the user just enough information to know about the features and get feedback from people that were not our users to make sure the UX was seamless and that would be understandable from both an entry level and someone with more familiarity with our platform.</p>

            <h3>Our plan of action</h3>
            <p>We initially refined our pages, revising the positions of the elements to make sure the experience remained simple and straightforward.</p>
            <p>Giving clear instructions on where to find live price of every asset and how to set a price alert was essential for us.</p>
            <p>At the same time we also had to focus on translating the browser platform into an iOS app. This included a major rebrand, and redesign of the new UX flow and the new UI with a wonderful and clear result.</p>
