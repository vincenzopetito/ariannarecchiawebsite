                <h3>The problem</h3>
                <p>Users had to use other websites or platforms to check the price of their assets which caused some frustration.Just as Gravity users want to complete transactions when it works for them, we want them to experience the same flexibility and control when it comes to checking a live asset’s price.</p>
                <h3>The goal</h3>
                <p>Allow users to set target prices for their assets, allowing them to make instant trades at their target price.</p>
                <h3>The research</h3>
                <p>Why do users want to have a constant overview of the market?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Switching between platforms</li>
                        <li>USD-only conversion of price assets</li>
                        <li>Simpler way to show data</li>
                        <li>Better understanding about when to Buy & Sell</li>

        <div class="cols three-cols">
            <div>
                <h4>- Building confidence</h4>
                <p>Build confidence by showing price in the last 24 hours, 7 days and 1 month. Create added value with the possibility to notify the users when their targeted price is reached, via email if offline and via toast notification if online.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>- Giving flexibility</h4>
                <p>Every user varies in trading needs, knowledge and experience. Allow for guidance, flexibility and adaptation to accomodate diverse demands and customisation.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>- Keeping it simple</h4>
                <p>Optimising the platform for an easy understanding of complex data without compromising how much information the users’ need to retain their engagement.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>- Check the price</h4>
                <p>Grant users all the information they need in order to interact with the platform and to best choose when it’s best time to Buy & Sell.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>- Create alerts</h4>

            <div>
                <h4>- Increase engagement</h4>
                <p>To ensure that they wouldn’t lose engagement with the platform, we need to use clear visuals and micro-interactions to help users understand what’s happening at each step.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>- Maintain structure</h4>
                <p>While assuring that the new design would create an increase in engagement, we have to make sure that the structure in place is mantained and regurarly tested.</p>

                <h3>First Observation</h3>
                <p>When we started this project we originally put the assets’ price in the balance page but after an internal usability test we quickly realised that people with little knowledge of crypto were very confused about what those numbers meant, so we revised and moved the price in the asset’s page.<br/><br/> We had to make sure the experience remained simple and straightforward. Working towards easing the information architecture on where to find live price of every asset and how to set a price alert was essential for us.</p>

                <h3>The final design</h3>
                <h4>Adding friction</h4>
                <p>After testing this solution we realised that adding a bit of friction in positioning the price in the Currency page instead of on the Investment page was actually preferred by the users which thought it made it ‘more tidy’.<br/><br/> The feedback was extremely positive, with many noting the convenience of having their assets’ prices available immediately. Also, adding an internal notification to help ‘highlight’ the price alert was quite successful and people were happy with this functionality.</p>
